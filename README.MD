- Further customization is available through the style drop-down, which sets the sample's style.
- Adjust the tempo live, from 120 bpm to 350 bpm.
- Mute button per channel, to allow for sound experimentation.

## Tech

Two work properly, the Beatmaker uses the following:

Contributions are more than welcome, as I am currently learning so I would love to see any changes.
